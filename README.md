## About
A hello webpack very basic tutorial without any HTTP integration. The only npm devDependencies for this package is webpac 4.

### Prerequisites
+ [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Npm (npm is installed with Node). [Install Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

### Description
Note this project does not include http. The project is basic and does not use `webpack.config.js` file. Webpack by default takes the files in the `src` folder and compiles and bundles them together to produce output `dist/main.js`.

### Run Application
````
npm install
npm run build  OR
npm run production

````

To see result,

```
open index.html
```

Open index.html in your browser. HTTP not required.

### Future Enhancements
+ Add HTTP
